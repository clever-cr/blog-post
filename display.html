     <p>When I was a classroom teacher, at least once a day, I had a student tell me, "I have nothing to write about!" My students were unaware of the incredible natural resource they possessed: their boundless creativity. Our children are natural storytellers. The depth of their imaginations never ceases to amaze me. And yet, our children approach a blank page with trepidation -- certain they have nothing to say.

        When most children set out to write, they aren't thinking about sharing their ideas and stories. More often than not, they're stressing about letter formation and proper spelling. When I ask my 6-year-old son to write, generally a small groan will escape his lips. For me, writing is therapeutic. It excites me. For him, writing is a pressure-cooker. "What do I write about?" "What if I can't spell something?" "How many sentences make a story?"
        
        However, if I ask my son to draw a picture, he immediately puts crayon to paper and begins to unleash his ideas. As he draws, what he may not realize is that he is telling a story. The pictures that our children draw contain so much meaning. There is so much information within an illustration. Don't believe me? Pick up a copy of Officer Buckle and Gloria by Peggy Rathmann or Mark Teague's  Dear Mrs. LaRue. If you were to simply listen to a reading of the book, you'd no doubt hear a great story. However, when you enjoy the story along with the illustrations, the story is made complete.
        
        The writer in me hopes that one day my son will fall in love with the act of putting pen to paper. Until that day comes, I want to inspire his creativity and affirm for him that he is a storyteller. I want him (and all children!) to know they have something to say.
        
        You can follow this basic process to help your child recognize that his/her drawing is a story, and that he/she is a natural-born storyteller.  
        
        1. Talk to your children about their drawings.
        Ask questions. Point out details. Encourage them to tell you about their pictures. Here are a few questions to ask:
